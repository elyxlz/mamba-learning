This is because `Mamba2Layer` is the correct class for the individual layers of the Mamba2 model, while `Mamba2` is the main model class. Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 233-247\n```python\n        self.layers = torch.nn.ModuleList(\n            [\n                torch.nn.ModuleDict(\n                    dict(\n                        mixer=Mamba2Layer(\n                            config,\n                        ),\n                        norm=RMSNorm(\n                            config.hidden_dim,\n                        ),\n                    )\n                )\n                for _ in range(config.num_layers)\n            ]\n        )\n```\n\nThis change replaces `Mamba2` with `Mamba2Layer` in the `mixer` initialization, which is the correct class to use for individual layers in the Mamba2 model. The rest of the code remains the same, ensuring that the model structure is correctly defined.", "request": "fix"}]
